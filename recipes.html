        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity.</p>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Stir the butter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add Â¼ cup of butter.</li>
                <li>Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Continue swirling until the batter is just set. Return skillet to the burner.</li>
                <li>Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds.</li>
